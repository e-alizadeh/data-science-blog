    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Scikit-LLM](https://github.com/iryna-kondr/scikit-llm) is a Python package that integrates large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-3 into the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) framework for text analysis tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-LLM is designed to work within the scikit-learn framework. \n",
    "Hence, if you're familiar with scikit-learn, you'll feel right at home with scikit-llm.\n",
    "The library offers a range of features, out of which we will cover the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zero-shot text classification\n",
    "- Multi-label zero-shot text classification \n",
    "- Text vectorization \n",
    "- Text translation\n",
    "- Text summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "You can install the library via pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install scikit-llm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "Before you start using Scikit-LLM, you need to pass your OpenAI API key to Scikit-LLM. \n",
    "You can check out this [post](www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/) to set up your OpenAI API key. "
